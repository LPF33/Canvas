# Canvas
Playing around with CANVAS!

### Moving Points - had to build this!
- Points move in random speed over the window, bounce against the wall and connect with a drawn line when distance < 60 (canvas pixels)
####See picture:

### Triangles - needed it for my Welcome page for the Social Network project
- triangles change color, when moving with mouse over a triangle
